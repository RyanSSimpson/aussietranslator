        <h3>Ok so lets get this straight because I know you have a few fucking questions.</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>NO, 'crikey' is not Aussie, it's Steve Irwin's fucken legacy mate. We as a country can claim him as a true blue Aussie icon, 
                but that phrase is his and his alone.</li>
            <li>They're prawns mate. Not shrimp. Where'd this even come from??</li>
            <li>Mate is an acceptable way to both start and end a sentence, mate.</li>
            <li>Cunt is not an insult among mates. If your mates being a dumbcunt let him know and have a laugh. It'll be your turn soon enough.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>With that out of the way, here is the (in)complete list of Aussie translations</h3>
